		<h1>iSongify</h1>
		<p class = "center">For this project in CS400, I developed a web app using Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm to find the shortest path between locations on the University of Wisconsin campus and identify nearby points, implementing backend solutions with a Hashtable and leveraging skills in <u>Java, JavaScript, HTML, Bash, JUnit, Git, Data Structures, and Algorithms</u>.</p>

		<h1>Campus Navigator Web App</h1>
		<p class = "center">For my second project in CS400, I built a console application that analyzes a song dataset to determine the most "danceable" tracks based on loudness and speed, utilizing a <u>Red Black Tree</u> for efficient sorting and applying skills in <u>Java, Bash, JUnit, Git, and Data Structures</u>.</p>

		<p>I have also made a couple console applications, which you can view on my <b>Github</b> (on the contact page).</p>
		<p>You can find descriptions of these console applications below:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt><b>Pomodoro Timer</b></dt>
			<dd>The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method based on 25-minute stretches of focused work broken by five-minute breaks. Longer breaks, typically 15 to 30 minutes, are taken after four consecutive work intervals. Each work interval is called a pomodoro, the Italian word for tomato (plural: pomodori).<br></dd>

			<dt><b>Simple Contact Manager</b></dt>
			<dd>Stores contacts with name, email, and phone number, and searches for contacts by name.<br></dd>

			<dt><b>Virtual Garage Sale</b></dt>
			<dd>List, price, and categorize items for sale.	<br></dd>

			<dt><b>Event Ticket Booking System</b></dt>
			<dd>Manage event tickets and available seats.</dd>
